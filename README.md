# Accountant Office

Accountant Office is an application for Accounting. It provides information about Departments, Employes and their salary.

The application uses three services to run:
- Accountant Office Api - based on .Net 7 API consisted of interaction with departments, employes and catalogs using PostgreSQL database
- Identity Server - for developing of this server was used [Duende](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v6) library
- Accountant Office Frontend - Angular based frontend application

## Installation

Make sure that you have docker installed on your PC.

Create file .env in root.
In .env file fill in
| var                    | description | note |
| ----                   | ----                                                            | ---- |
| `POSTGRES_USER`        | database user                                                   | This variables will be used in docker-compose.yaml for db creation and comunication api with db. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`    | database user password                                          |^     |
| `POSTGRES_DB`          | database name                                                   |^     |
| `CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | this password the same as was used when https cert was creating | ??   |

with data you will use for database creation. This are variables which are used in docker-compose.yaml for db creation and comunication api with db.


Then in the root directory use the next commands:

```bash
docker compose build
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:80/ as soon as docker launches necessary container.

The backend API can be found at http://localhost:5010/swagger/index.html

### Note

The Identity Server uses self-signed development certificates for hosting pre-built images over localhost. The instructions are similar to using production certificates. The certificate generated by dotnet dev-certs is for use with localhost only and should not be used in an environment like Kubernetes. To support HTTPS within a Kubernetes cluster, use the tools provided by Manage TLS Certificates in a Cluster to setup TLS within pods.

### Useful links

For applying certificates was used [Hosting ASP.NET Core images with Docker Compose over HTTPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/docker-compose-https?view=aspnetcore-7.0)

For frontend part for Auth is [oidc-client-ts library](https://authts.github.io/oidc-client-ts/index.html)

# ToDo

* Different user roles
* Admin Page with new user creation, catalogs management
* Separate service with report generation
